# Option-Pricing-with-DL

This repository contains work done for LUISS Guido Carli University, Rome, Italy, in the field of financial option pricing.

## Overview

To understand what options are and the main models in literature to price them, I recommend reading my Bachelor's Degree Thesis, which is a comparison and Excel implementation of some of the best models in literature: [From Black-Scholes to Heston - Applicability to the Financial Markets (in Italian)](https://github.com/Giampot/Option-Pricing-with-DL/blob/master/LF1705540.pdf).

Following that, you can explore the implementation of a Deep Learning model that outperformed the Black-Scholes model on a dataset of nearly 1,000,000 options:

- [Data Preparation](https://github.com/Giampot/Option-Pricing-with-DL/blob/master/Data%20preparation.ipynb)
- [Black-Scholes Implementation](https://github.com/Giampot/Option-Pricing-with-DL/blob/master/Black-Scholes%20implementation.ipynb)
